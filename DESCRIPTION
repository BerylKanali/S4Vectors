Package: S4Vectors
Title: S4 implementation of vectors and lists
Description: The S4Vectors package defines the Vector and List virtual classes
	and a set of generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary
	vector and lists in R. Package developers can easily implement
	vector-like or list-like objects as concrete subclasses of Vector or
	List. In addition, a few low-level concrete subclasses of general
	interest are implemented in S4Vectors itself: Rle, DataFrame, and Hits.
	Many more are implemented in the IRanges package and other Bioconductor
	infrastructure packages.
